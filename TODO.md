# TODO: Create Dynamic Club Detail Page

- [x] Add getClubById function in backend/controllers/club.controller.js
- [x] Add route GET /api/clubs/:id in backend/routes/club.route.js
- [x] Update frontend/src/pages/Clubs.jsx to fetch clubs from /api/clubs and set links to /clubs/{club.\_id}
- [x] Create frontend/src/pages/ClubDetail.jsx to fetch and display club details by id
- [x] Add route /clubs/:id in frontend/src/App.jsx
- [ ] Test the full flow: clubs page loads from backend, cards link to detail page, detail page fetches and displays club info
